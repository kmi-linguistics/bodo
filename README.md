# Bodo
This repository contains all the resources (corpora) of Bodo and tools that were developed for creating and managing these resources.

The 'corpus' folder contains the complete raw data and the 'frequency-lists' contains the frequency-ordered word and punctuation list.

These are being made available for further research and expansion at no cost. However, if you are interested in making a commercial usage of these resources, please contact the creators of this project.

More tools and data is expected to be added and these ones modified in the future.
